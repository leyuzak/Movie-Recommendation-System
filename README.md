# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A lightweight and efficient movie recommendation system built using the **MovieLens 100K** dataset.  
The project focuses on simplicity, interpretability, and deployability, using an **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** approach and deployed as a **Streamlit app inside a Hugging Face Docker Space**.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a small-size yet effective movie recommendation system that can generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences.  
Special emphasis is placed on:
- keeping the model artifact small
- ensuring fast inference
- enabling easy deployment on platforms such as Hugging Face

## 📊 Dataset Description
The project uses the **MovieLens 100K** dataset, a widely adopted benchmark in recommendation systems research.

**Dataset statistics:**
- 100,000 ratings
- 943 users
- 1,682 movies
- Rating scale: 1–5

Each rating consists of:
- user ID
- movie ID
- rating
- timestamp

Additional metadata includes movie titles, release dates, genres, and basic user information.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the structure and behavior of the data, including:
- rating distribution analysis
- identification of most active users
- identification of most rated movies
- missing value inspection
- sparsity analysis of the user–item matrix
- detection of rating bias

The full EDA process and visualizations can be found in the Kaggle notebook linked above.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps include:
- removal of irrelevant or highly missing columns
- handling of missing values
- deduplication of user–item interactions
- data type normalization
- construction of a user–item matrix
- optional filtering of extremely inactive users or rarely rated items

These steps ensure a clean and model-ready dataset.

## 🤖 Model Overview
The recommendation engine is based on **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** using **cosine similarity**.

### Key characteristics:
- no iterative training required
- similarity computed between movie vectors
- only **top-K most similar items** per movie are stored
- very small model artifact size (suitable for GitHub & Hugging Face)

### Recommendation logic:
User preferences are inferred from previously rated movies, and recommendations are generated by aggregating similarity-weighted scores from neighboring items.

---

## 🖥️ Deployment
The system is deployed as a **Streamlit application inside a Docker-based Hugging Face Space**.

**Tech stack:**
- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Docker
- Hugging Face Spaces

Users can:
- search for movies
- assign ratings
- build a personal watch history
- receive real-time movie recommendations
